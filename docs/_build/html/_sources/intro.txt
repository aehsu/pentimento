Introduction to Pentimento
===========================
 Pentimento is the flexible editor for non-sequential authoring of online lectures. It allows for easy editing of mistakes made during lecture creation, without the need to go back and re-record the mistaken section. Instead, lecturers have the option to apply **retroactive edits** to the recording, allowing for multiple re-runs. We hope that the flexibility the system afford content creators will lead to a faster time to high-quality production, eliminating the need to completely restart lectures on any mistake.

 Features which are currently supported in Pentimento include:
  * independent recording of visuals
  * independent recording of audio
  * simultaneous recording of both audio and visual
  * retroactive edits of visuals
  * visualization of audio channel
  * synchronization of audio to pre-recorded visuals
  * re-recording of audio
  * layering of multiple audio tracks
  * exportation of lecture into a ``zip`` package

 Pentimento is currrently under development by the MIT Computer Graphics Group, and is released under the MIT license. The technical paper for Pentimento can be found `here <http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/tmp/pentimento2014.pdf>`_.

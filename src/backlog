+ SELECT, then adjust SLIDER. SELECTION still exists, but not highlighted.

+ SELECT, then RECORD. SELECTION still exists, and is highlighted.

+ enable DELETE with new architecture
-[extra whitespace at the end...]
-[deletion leads new visuals to appear if you delete anytime between visuals. this is weird, but the desired behavior]

+ enable REDRAW with new architecture

+ selection of visuals not currently alive is allowed

ensure consistency with convention:
//The convention is to include the duration for which slide you're on, i.e. (start, end]
//For example, slides have these durations: [10, 10, 10, 10].
//Times [1-10] are for slide 0, [11-20] are for slide 1, [21-30] are for slide 2, [31-40] are for slide 3.
//Time 0 is treated special.

undo
[1. insertion of recording]
[2. deletion] / [2. redrawing] >> implies tool controller handles
[3. visual change]
Overall: [1. recording, 2. batches, 3. individuals?] Maybe can completely localize to tools controller?
